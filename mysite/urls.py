"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from register import views as v

# This line means that for every URL that starts with admin/, Django will find a corresponding view.

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('register/',v.register, name="register"),
    path('', include('blog.urls')),
    path('', include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
